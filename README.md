# ftp2--gsheet
 FTP server has folders (external) where new files arrive in"external/new" timestamps in their filenames. I want to automatically update a Google Sheet (with ID, Date, Start-time columns) whenever a new file appears. This sheet should be populated with the file's unique identifier(extracted from the filename)date, and start time from the timestamp.
